📦 Iron Codex — Modular Foundry VTT Enhancements (v13+)

Iron Codex is a lightweight, modular plugin for Foundry VTT (v13+) that stands in for Monk’s Helper modules while he gets them updated. Each enhancement is self-contained and can be individually enabled via world settings.

🛠️ Features include:
	•	🎯 Remove Target on NPC Turn End — Clears player targets when an NPC finishes their turn
	•	🌀 Combat Round Messages — Broadcasts concise round updates to all players
	•	📤 Popout Combat Tracker — Automatically opens the combat tab in a floating window at the start of combat
	•	🌟 Find My Token — Adds a toolbar button to quickly locate and cycle your owned tokens
	•	⚠️ Turn Alerts — Displays a warning when it becomes your turn (per-player opt-in)
	•	🎭 Combat Placeholders — Inserts placeholder combatants for GM tracking or timing tools

🔧 Built entirely with Foundry VTT v13’s modern ApplicationV2 and Hooks API — no legacy code.

The Iron Codex is a modular toolkit for Foundry VTT v13, designed to enhance gameplay through lightweight, focused utilities. Built as a successor to select features from Monk’s Little Helper, Iron Codex emphasizes clean separation of functionality, allowing each feature to be enabled or disabled individually by the Game Master. Every tool is carefully crafted using only the official v13 API, ensuring compatibility, stability, and ease of maintenance.

Each feature in Iron Codex is implemented in its own file, enabling GMs to pick and choose only the tools they want. Current features include auto-removing targets when NPC turns end, minimal combat round announcements, automatic popout of the combat tracker, a “Find My Token” button for players, player-specific turn alerts, and the ability to insert placeholder combatants for encounter planning. These tools are optimized for clarity and performance without adding bloat or visual clutter.

The project is designed for extensibility and transparency. Iron Codex avoids global state, external dependencies, and legacy code, making it an ideal foundation for custom module development. Whether you’re streamlining combat, helping players stay oriented, or preparing narrative scenes more efficiently, Iron Codex provides a stable, modular foundation to make your Foundry VTT games smoother and more immersive.
